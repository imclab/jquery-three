## jQuery Three 

A plugin - extension of the jQuery API for 3d objects (using Three.js) 


## Scope

Rendering and manipulating 3D objects on the web should be as simple and any other element in the DOM. This plugin takes all the syntax conventions of jQuery and applies them in 3D content created with Three.js - effectively making the 3D renderer a background component the web app is not directly interfacing with. 


## Usage

Enable 3D actions on any container using: 

```
$("container").three( options, callback );
```

## Installation

Get the latest version using bower: 
```
bower install jquery.three
```

## Roadmap

The library is still in early experimental phase - read the wiki docs for more details as the api is solidified.
