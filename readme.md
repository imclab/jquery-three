## jQuery Three 

A plugin / extension of the jQuery API for 3d objects (using Three.js) 


## Introduction 

jQuery Three was developed to bridge the gap between WebGL and the DOM by using existing conventions web designers are already familiar with.

Effectively it provides a higher level api that abstracts Three.js methods to known common conventions from web development.


## Install

Get the latest (stable) version using bower: 
```
bower install jquery.three

```
