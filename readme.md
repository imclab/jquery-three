## jQuery Three 

A plugin - extension of the jQuery API for 3d objects (using Three.js) 


## Introduction 

jQuery Three was developed to bridge the gap between WebGL and the DOM by using existing conventions web designers are already familiar with.

Effectively it provides a higher level api that abstracts Three.js methods to known common conventions from web development.


## Install

Get the latest (stable) version using bower: 
```
bower install jquery.three
```

## Usage

Enable 3D actions on any container using: 

```
$("container").three( options, callback );
```

Read the [wiki](wiki) docs for more details on the [methods](wiki/Methods) and [tag support](wiki/Tags).
